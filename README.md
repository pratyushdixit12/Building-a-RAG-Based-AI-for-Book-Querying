# Building-a-RAG-Based-AI-for-Book-Querying
In this project, we built an AI system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to query a dataset of books. Given a word input, the AI retrieves relevant passages from the uploaded books and generates a response. This approach enhances information retrieval, making book content more accessible."
